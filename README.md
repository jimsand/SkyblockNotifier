# SkyblockNotifier

SkyblockNotifier is a simple chat bot for Discord using discord.js v14.
Its sole purpose is to inform users if their player has been disconnected from their private island for any reason.
  This is done through direct messaging the user.

# Usage

Create a .env file containing the four secrets:
 1. Discord Bot Token = TOKEN
 2. Discord User ID = DISCORD_ID
 3. Minecraft UUID = UUID
 4. Hypixel API Key = API_KEY

# TODO:
 1. Allow Toggleability (as the current solution is to just turn on and off the bot)
 2. Allow for multiple users (as currently the bot only supports one)
